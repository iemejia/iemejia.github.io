            <p>I've been passionate about computers since I can
            remember, for that reason I decided to become a Software
            Engineer. In that process I developed a great interest for
            the construction of large software projects which can
            improve the life and experience of many users. I'm
            particularly interested in systems known as large scale
            distributed systems which are the core of most of the web
            businesses and medium to big enterprises today. </p>

            <p>I'm also interested in innovative ways to
            design scalable distributed systems (Cloud
            computing, Big Data Systems, Grids, etc...). In particular, I'm interested in
            adaptability and systems which are able to fix themselves
            also called (self-* systems). I have many years
            of experience in the software industry. I was lucky to be part of
            large projects where I saw the challenges of real systems in
            different business areas from telcos, taxes and financial
            systems.</p>

            <p>Apart from my experiences in the industry I have always
            been interested in having solid academic foundations to do
            my work as best as possible, for that reason I decided to
            work towards a PhD in this domain, I expect that both my research
            and industry experience can contribute to create better systems.</p>

            <p>I really appreciate when the work I do is useful to as
            many people as possible, for that reason I love to engage
            in big projects, in particular I love projects which are
            challenging but rewarding. I love to design and create
            products from the beginning to the last stage. I prefer to
            work in groups, in the future I would like to manage teams
            to design, build and improve products. My plan is to
            continue learning and adquiring new technical and
            management competences in order to do so.</p>

            <p>I also feel confortable helping different parties with
            their problems, I would like to offer my abilities as well
            as my personal background and culture to help fixing other
            people problems. I love to discuss and teach since that
            gives me the chance to give back some of the knowledge I
            have acquired.</p>

            <h1>Education</h1>
              <h2>PhD Computer Science [not finished]</h2>
                <p>École des Mines de Nantes, France, 2009-</p>
                <p>I was a PhD student, part of the ASCOLA
                group. The purpose of my research was to find better
                ways to modularize crosscutting concerns in large
                scale systems (where distribution and concurrency
                matter). Concretely I extended and formalized the
                concepts of invasive patterns, distributed aspects and
                architectural programming.</p>

              <h2>M.Sc. Systems and Computing Engineering</h2>
                <p>Universidad de los Andes. Colombia, 2008</p>
                <p>I worked in the design of a language and
                infrastructure to adapt software
                architectures. We created little
                language (not turing complete) that let the users
                describe Software Architectures (like an ADL) but also let
                them write adaptation rules of the architecture's
                elements. The result of my work was integrated in a
                simple SOA architecture
                called <a href="http://tongo.uniandes.edu.co"

              <h2>B.Sc. Systems and Computing Engineering</h2>
                <p>Universidad Nacional de Colombia, 2004 </p>
                <p>I created an educational tool to help students to test most of the concepts of an introductory Theory of computation course: (e.g. Automatas, NDA, regular grammars and Turing Machines</p>

            <p>I have benefitted for long time of open-source
            projects, so finally in 2014 I decided that it was time
            to start contributing back. First via sharing my own
            projects (even the silliest ones. Most of these projects
            have been co-writen with my big
            pal <a href="http://github.com/rgamez">Rubén</a>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/iemejia/catho/">catho</a>:
                A commandline tool to catalog media, inspired by the
                fabulous <a href="http://www.mtg.sk/rva/">Cathy</a>
                project of Robert Vasicek. </li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/iemejia/calibrecolombia/">calibre-colombia</a>:
                Recipes to generate and follow colombian newspapers
                and magazines using the <a href="#">Calibre</a> e-book
                management tool .</li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/iemejia/streamingcolombia/">streamingcolombia</a>:
                A playlist generator to watch colombian TV
                from <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a>. You
                just have to
                import <a href="https://raw.github.com/iemejia/streamingcolombia/master/tvcolombia-static.m3u">this

            <p>I have also collaborated actively in open-source
            projects related to education. I was very impressed with
            the opportunity of online education and MOOCs, so I
            enhanced tools to follow such courses, among others:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a>:
                A popular commandline tool to download videos. I wrote
                most of the backend functionality to download
                subtitles, as well as the support for Youtube,
                Dailymotion and the TED conference.</li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/coursera-dl/coursera/">coursera-dl</a>:
                A tool to download courses from coursera. I wrote
                mostly fixes and refactorings.</li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/shk3/edx-downloader/">edx-dl</a>:
                A tool to download courses from the Open Edx platform,
                I wrote the support for subtitles + direct CDN
                downloading among other fixes and refactorings.</li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/weblabdeusto/weblabdeusto/">weblabdeusto</a>:
                A nice remote laboratory manager. I'm currently
                working on some improvements for the reservation
                engine, as part of a collaboration with researchers
                from Universidad de los Andes.</li>

            <p>I've been living in France since 2009. I arrived to
            this country without knowing any single French word and this
            experience made me realize and discover many things e.g. the
            importance of different languages and cultures. It also renewed my
            love for history and geopolitics.</p>

            <p>I love music, many different and sometimes incongruent
            styles, I love to go to concerts. I also amuse myself
            playing guitars and synths. I'm not a qualified musician,
            but from time to time I try to produce some noise with my
            guitar and computer. Recently I started learning how to
            play the drums.</p>

            <p>Traveling is one of my favorite activities, it's the
            most gratifying learning experience I've ever had. Thanks
            to that passion I have gone to really diverse places that
            I never expected to see such as Thailand, Iceland and the
            Patagonia. I expect to continue exploring the world and
            learning from different cultures. </p>

            <p>I'm interested in cooking (and eating of course), I'm particularly attracted
            to South European cooking (Spanish, Italian and Greek),
            South-Asian cuisine (Indian and Thai), and of course
            Latin-American cuisine where my favorite dishes are from the
            Peruvian and Colombian traditions.</p>

            <p>I have a recent interest in cognitive psychology
            and the work of Daniel Kahneman and others in cognitive
            illusions, unconscious bias and irrationality. I'm
            really a debutant in the subject, but I find it amusing, in
            particular when I contrast some of these ideas with the
            practices of my profession and my daily life.</p>
